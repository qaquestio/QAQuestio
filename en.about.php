            There are probably millions of books, magazines, columns, and guides on how best to deal with the contradictions that constantly 
            open up between reality and our desires and ideals.
            </br></br>
            We may try to find shortcuts to these ideals, and may find out that they do not exist. 
            Or as the philosopher Konersmann describes it: "Our fantasy of paradise is something other than what [...] paradies should have been."
            </br></br>
            However, at some point we want to get to conclusions, reach milestones on our quest for answers and find some peace of mind.
            </br></br>
            And even though there are probably as many definitions for these great ideas like "happiness" and "success" as there live people in this 
            world, they do have one thing in common.
            Whatever they mean to us, the path to our own clearer understanding begins with asking ourselves the right questions.  
            </br></br></br>
